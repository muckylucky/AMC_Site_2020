INTRO UX
I am an outcome driven UX Designer with a passion for the way users acheive their outcomes with our SaaS software. I hate terrible user experiences.

At Infobip I have worked in the Growth and the Marketing Automation teams. My specialisation is SaaS marketing automation software and Product Led Growth.

My experience as a front-end developer means I am familiar with the implementation of designs and can communicate effectively with engineers deliver projects in a fast paced Agile environment.

I also own my family nameâ€™s dotcom address :)


Strengths
User testing evangelist
	Once did testing using paper prototypes remotely. I've done loads of user testing with clients both on and off site. 
Miro hero
	I love a Miro board and probably spend 70% of my time there
Outcomes over output
	I design user journeys, not screens. I like to deep-dive my projects and get a thorough understanding of the big picture to identify wider problems, not quick fixes. I'm also big on analytics and how they can inform our designs.
Inclusivity
	Facilitating workshops is my superpower (not my words!) and I truly believe that design is inclusive. Good results are not conjured up by lone designers but are the culmination of teamwork.
