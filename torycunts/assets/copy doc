INTRO

Welcome fellow flag-shaggers. How many Union Jacks can you see on this page? I'll tell you: FUCKING LOADS. That makes me an absolute patriot and thereby gains me immunity on an international basis from arguments that use morals or logic as their basis.
Anyone who feels 'triggered' by the content of this website go go and build their fucking own and live there.

Priti Patel

----- WHO

The Home Secretary. Also formerly the International Development Secretary before having to quiit because she was having unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials therreby breaching ministerial code.
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41923007

Many Tories have something quite comical about them but not Priti. Priti positively exudes menace and contempt towards anyone around her. I strongly suspect that she has a supernatural hatred of all human life, primarily, but also all living things in general. Should she ever read this then I strongly suspect I'll be spending ssome time in the future in the company of two burly former special forces goons being suspended upside down in a disused facrtory space near the Edexcel center having Irn-Bru funneled down my nose.
