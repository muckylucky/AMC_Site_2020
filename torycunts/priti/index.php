            <h2>Who</h2>
            <p>The Home Secretary. Also formerly the International Development Secretary before having to quiit because she was having <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41923007">unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials</a> thereby breaching ministerial code.</p>
            <p>Many Tories have something quite comical about them but not Priti. Priti positively exudes menace and contempt towards anyone around her. I strongly suspect that she has a supernatural hatred of all human life, primarily, but also all living things in general. Should she ever read this then I strongly suspect I'll be spending ssome time in the future in the company of two burly former special forces goons being suspended upside down in a disused factory space near the Edexcel center having Irn-Bru funneled down my nose.</p>
