INTRO UX
I am an email front end developer with a background in design and a passion for user experience. I build responsive emails, web pages and engaging campaigns for various clients at Selligent. 
Working with a Technical Project Manager we take requirements from client, formulate briefs/statements of work and develop journeys (Campaigns) and assets to fulfill those requirements. 
I am highly proficient in all modern front-end web technologies but also understand clients' data and know how to use it to build highly segmented journeys that target customers using advanced 
personalisation techniques. Every journey starts with a problem and I’m the person that gets the client to the solution.

Currently I work as part of the Growth and Self-Service design team at Infobip. Our primary concerns are onboarding Self-Serve signups, engaging with their business cases/needs and converting them from free trial to paying users.
We work closely with Marketing, Product Led Growth and of course engineering and product management. The Growth design team is part of the larger Product Design team of some 35 designers at Infobip.
